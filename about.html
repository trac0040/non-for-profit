		<p>READ (Rural Education and Development) Global believes that empowering rural
		communities is key to alleviating global poverty. READ partners with rural villages to establish community
		library and resource centers (READ Centers) as vehicles for social and economic transformation. More than half of women are illiterate in South Asia,
		and in the rural communities where READ works, few economic opportunities exist. </p>
		<p>

		<p>Centers are owned and operated by the local community, and offer training programs to people of all ages and backgrounds
		in the areas of education, economic empowerment, technology, and women's empowerment.</p>

	<div class="island unit unit-xs-1 unit-s-1 unit-m-1-2 unit-l-1-2">
		<p>Since 1991, the READ model has evolved from the simple idea of a rural library to a thriving network of READ Centers and sustaining enterprises.
		To date, 71 READ Centers and 103 sustaining enterprises have been established across Bhutan, India and Nepal, providing access to more than 2 million rural villagers.</p>

		<p>Every day, rural villagers are visiting READ Centers and improving their reading skills, gaining new livelihood skills to help them earn a living,
		learning how to access the Internet or accessing critical health information.</p>

          <h2 class="why"> Why Bhutan?</h2>
          <p>Although Bhutan is known for the beauty of its mountains and "Gross National Happiness",
          most of the population lives in remote areas with rugged terrain and
          few educational or economic opportunities. Bhutan has one of the lowest literacy rates in Asia,
          and before READ established our first Center there, there was only one public lending library in the entire country.
          Bhutan was closed off from the rest of the modern world until the 1960s.
					READ Global is one of the only international non-profit organizations operating in Bhutan. </p>

        	<h2 class="why"> Why India?</h2>
          <p>Poverty tears many families apart in rural India when villagers are forced to migrate to urban centers to look for work.
          Although India has one of the fastest growing economies in the world, 25.7% of the rural population still lives below
          the poverty line. There are more illiterate people in India than in any other country in the world. Women are impacted the most:
          one woman out of three is illiterate, and education is rarely prioritized for girls, leaving them without the skills they need
          to earn an income to support their families.</p>

        <h2 class="why"> Why Nepal?</h2>
          <p>With about 27 million people - more than half living on less than $2 per day -
          Nepal is one of the poorest countries in the world.
          For more than half of the rural population,  it takes longer than half an hour to get to the
          nearest all-weather road, making it hard for rural Nepalis to access resources.
          Social norms make girls’ education a low priority,
          and as a result 53.3% of women can’t read. Schools are often inaccessible and have no books
          for a library or resources for a computer lab. Furthermore, less than 30% of the rural population has access to electricity.</p>
